    <div class="ScratchParagraph"><p>When I came to BYU, my brother was also still studying here, and I was able to do a lot of things with him over the course of my Freshman and Sophomore years.  At one point, when my Sophomore year was about to start, my brother issued a challenge to me.  He wanted to have a competition to see who could visit the most bathrooms on campus during the year.  I declined because I thought it was ridiculous and would be a pain to find all these bathrooms when I was in a hurry to get to my classes.  But I soon came to my senses, and accepted his challenge.  I don't think he ended up doing too much with it, but I kept a detailed list of every bathroom I visited on campus.  It has become quite extensive, and actually became quite useful.  If I'm late to class but need to use the bathroom, I can easily direct my path to class to include the most convenient bathroom.  I know exactly where they are, and by extension, I also know where the drinking fountains are.  As I continued this process, I found that not all the bathrooms were equal.  Some stood out as clearly better than the rest.  Here is my top 5 list, with some reasons why they are among the elite:</p></div>
        <div class="List">
            <ol>
                <li>Eyring Science Center 4th floor: C453A</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peaceful - few people use it; poop worry free</li>
                    <li>Bright - lots of natural light; sometimes that's all the sun a college student can hope for</li>
                    <li>Hidden - feels like a secret and everybody likes to know secrets</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="container">
                    <img src="assets/img/ESC4th.jpeg" alt="ESC 4th Floor Bathroom">
                </div>
                <li>Bensen Building Basement: W013</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Massive - this room is huge; it feels like the entire building could fit in there</li>
                    <li>Convenient - it's in one of the most travelled buildings on campus</li>
                    <li>Lots of stalls - take your time, there's nobody waiting</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="container">
                    <img src="assets/img/ESC4th.jpeg" alt="ESC 4th Floor Bathroom">
                </div>
                <li>Nichols Building Single Person: 102, 106</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>High Quality - modern with lots of light (1000000000% nicer than your apartment bathroom)</li>
                    <li>Convenient - located near one of the most popular walkways on campus</li>
                    <li>Private - no need to worry about the awkward bathroom interactions</li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <li>Herald R. Clark Building Basement: 138</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feels Exciting - There's a slight element of fear from the step up into the restroom and the big caution sign where you can put a dent in your head as you come out of the stall.</li>
                    <li>Your Own World - The main stall has the ceiling lowered just outside, making it feel like your own little cave of privacy.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Secret - Located in one of the coolest places on campus.  It feels like a restricted mad scientist area, but it's open to everyone</li>
                    <li>Convenience - Next to the elevators, and near the center of campus.</li>
